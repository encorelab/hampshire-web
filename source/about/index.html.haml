				%h4 Tim Zimmerman
				%p I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Cognition and Education in the School of Cognitive Sciences at Hampshire College [www.hampshire.edu].  As a learning sciences researcher, I focus on the learning of ocean and environmental science concepts and the design of learning tools that enhance such learning.  I study science learning across formal (classroom) and informal [informalscience.org] (outdoor, aquarium, museums, field trips, etc.) contexts, the use of science knowledge for environmental decision-making.  My work often involves the design and use of Internet-connected, wired and mobile devices as learning tools.

				%h4 Jonathan Gardner
				%p I am a student at Hampshire College studying the ways in which digital technologies have changed and will continue to change how people learn and think about learning.  My specific interests include leveraging games and game design for learning purposes, the Internetâ€™s potential for promoting scientific literacy, and the effects of a digital media saturated world on cognition.

				%h4 Chelsea LaValley
				%p I am a Hampshire College student studying education, psychology and emotion studies. I specifically am interested in social-emotional learning in education. My concentration involves finding a correlation between SEL and academic achievement; to promote mental health services in the United States public education system. I am originally from Taos, New Mexico and will graduate from Hampshire in the spring of 2015!

				%h4 Jim Slotta
				%p Jim Slotta is an associate professor of education in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at The University of Toronto, where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Education and Technology.  In 2006, he established the ENCORE lab, a team of talented students, designers and developers who investigate collaborative inquiry learning in formal (K-12) and informal (home, field and museum) settings. In collaboration with researchers from Oslo, Chicago and Berkeley, Slotta and his team have developed the Scalable Architecture for Interactive Learning (SAIL), as well as a framework for smart classroom research called SAIL Smart Space.  Recent funded projects have examined the use of embedded phenomena in elementary classrooms, distributed and ubiquitous learning in high school physics, and an immersive rainforest simulation for high school biology.  Together, these projects have advanced a theoretical model known as Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI).  Professor Slotta and his team have published their work widely, as seen in the publications section of this site.  Taken together, this work examines how K-12 students can become a knowledge community, supported by technology, that enables inclusive participation and promotes the growth of ideas.
